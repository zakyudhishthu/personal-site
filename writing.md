My writing is organized by approach rather than topic or geography. Some pieces blend categories—quantitative work often includes policy arguments, and policy pieces frequently draw on data—but this structure highlights the range of what I do.

**Quantitative Analysis** features data-driven pieces using Census/ACS data, regression analysis, and demographic trends. **Policy Advocacy** includes opinion pieces, policy recommendations, and legislative analysis. **Urban Commentary** collects broader essays on cities, culture, and the ideas behind urban policy.
