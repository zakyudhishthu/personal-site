## Active Research

I'm currently focused on several interconnected projects:

### Chicago Neighborhood Analysis

Deepening my quantitative work on Chicago neighborhoods, with particular attention to:
- Demographic change in Lake View, Logan Square, North Center, and the downtown/Near North area
- The role of deconversions in reshaping neighborhood composition
- How new construction's bedroom mix affects where families with children locate
- Comparative analysis across community areas with different zoning and development patterns

### Comparative Policy Analysis

What can Chicago learn from Twin Cities housing reforms—and vice versa? I'm interested in:
- How Minneapolis 2040's outcomes might inform Chicago's zoning debates
- The different political economies of housing reform in each region
- Aldermanic privilege vs. traditional zoning: institutional comparisons
- State preemption efforts in Minnesota and Illinois

### Lot Size Research

Continuing work on lot size regulations, including:
- Hedonic regression analysis isolating the effect of lot size minimums on housing prices
- How nonconforming lots create natural experiments in housing outcomes
- Policy design for lot size reform

## Ongoing Questions

These are the questions that animate my research and writing:

<ul class="questions-list">
<li>How do zoning regulations shape neighborhood change and housing affordability over time?</li>
<li>What makes housing policy reforms politically feasible—and what makes them effective once enacted?</li>
<li>How can quantitative analysis better inform local policy debates without losing nuance?</li>
<li>What role does housing supply play in neighborhood demographic shifts, and how do we disentangle supply from demand factors?</li>
<li>How do past planning and zoning decisions create path dependencies that constrain current options?</li>
</ul>

## Future Directions

Looking ahead, I'm interested in:

**Expanding geographic scope** — While my deep expertise is in the Twin Cities and Chicago, housing policy debates are national. I want to engage more with research from other metros and bring comparative perspectives to my work.

**Deeper methodological engagement** — Strengthening my econometric toolkit, particularly around causal inference and policy evaluation methods.

**Bridging research and practice** — Finding ways to make academic housing research more accessible and actionable for local policymakers and advocates.

**Urban history** — Understanding how historical planning decisions, redlining, urban renewal, and institutional development shaped the housing markets we have today.

## Currently Reading

I try to balance housing economics research with urban history, political economy, and broader intellectual interests. Recent and current reading includes:
