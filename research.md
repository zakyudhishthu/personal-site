## My Analytical Approach

I combine quantitative methods with accessible policy writing to make housing research useful for practitioners, advocates, and interested readers. My work emphasizes:

- **Census & ACS data** at the tract level for demographic and housing analysis
- **R programming** for statistical analysis, visualization, and spatial work
- **Hedonic regression** to isolate policy effects on housing prices and characteristics
- **Residualized bins** for communicating regression results visually
- **Clear translation** of statistical findings into policy recommendations

My approach prioritizes both rigor and accessibility. I use standard econometric techniques—hedonic regression, difference-in-differences where appropriate, careful attention to confounding—while presenting results in ways that policy audiences can understand and use. The "residualized bins" approach, for instance, allows me to show regression relationships visually while controlling for covariates.

## Research Areas

<h3>Twin Cities (2020–2024)</h3>

<div class="card-grid">

<div class="card" markdown="1">
<h4>Minneapolis 2040 Plan</h4>

Evaluation of development outcomes following Minneapolis's landmark comprehensive plan, including mapping permit data, analyzing housing type mix, and assessing early impacts on housing supply and prices.
</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">
<h4>Lot Size Regulations</h4>

Research on minimum lot size requirements and their effects on housing affordability, supply, and neighborhood character. Includes parcel-level analysis and hedonic regression work (forthcoming).
</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">
<h4>Inclusionary Zoning</h4>

Analysis of policy design choices in inclusionary zoning programs, including who bears the costs of affordability mandates and how program features affect housing production.
</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">
<h4>State Zoning Reform</h4>

Analysis of Minnesota's HF4246 and the politics of state preemption of local zoning, including testimony at the Legislature and ongoing coverage of reform efforts.
</div>

</div>

<h3>Chicago (2024–present)</h3>

<div class="card-grid">

<div class="card" markdown="1">
<h4>Neighborhood Demographics</h4>

Census/ACS analysis of demographic change in Chicago neighborhoods—Logan Square, North Center, Lake View, downtown—focusing on population, household composition, and housing unit dynamics.
</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">
<h4>Deconversions</h4>

Research on housing deconversions (multi-unit to single-family conversions) and their impact on neighborhood composition, affordability, and population capacity.
</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">
<h4>Family Housing Patterns</h4>

Analysis of where families with children live in Chicago, bedroom mix in new construction, and how housing supply shapes demographic outcomes.
</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">
<h4>Chicago Zoning History</h4>

Research on Chicago's zoning evolution, the Planned Development process, aldermanic privilege, and how institutional history shapes current policy debates.
</div>

## Methodological Interests

Beyond specific policy questions, I'm interested in:

- **Housing market dynamics** — How do local housing markets adjust to supply and demand changes? What determines price formation at the neighborhood level?

- **Policy evaluation** — How can we assess the effects of zoning reforms, affordability mandates, and other interventions using quasi-experimental methods?

- **Urban history** — How do past planning decisions create path dependencies that shape current housing markets and policy options?

- **Data visualization** — How can we communicate complex statistical findings to policy audiences effectively?
