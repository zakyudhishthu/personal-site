## What I Do

I analyze housing markets and urban policy using Census and American Community Survey data, statistical methods including hedonic regression, and data visualization in R. My work bridges the gap between rigorous quantitative analysis and accessible policy writing.

My geographic focus has evolved from the **Twin Cities**, where I was involved in local housing advocacy and served on the board of Sustain Saint Paul, to **Chicago**, where I now work as an economic research assistant and continue to write about neighborhood change and housing dynamics.

My writing spans three modes: **quantitative research** that digs into demographic trends and housing data, **policy advocacy** that makes the case for specific reforms, and **broader commentary** on urban life and the intellectual questions that animate this work.

## Background

I graduated from **Macalester College** in 2024 with a major in Economics and minors in Statistics and Music. During my time in St. Paul, I became deeply engaged with Twin Cities housing policy—writing for Streets.mn and Minnesota Reformer, testifying at the Minnesota Legislature on zoning reform (HF4246), and serving on the board of Sustain Saint Paul.

Now based in Chicago, I continue writing at [Pencilling Out](https://pencillingout.substack.com), my Substack with 537+ subscribers, while working as an economic research assistant. I'm particularly interested in how Chicago's housing dynamics compare to the Twin Cities and what each region can learn from the other.
